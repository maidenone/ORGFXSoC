Xilinx DDR2 controller with Wishbone interface

This is a Xilinx technology-dependent DDR2 memory controller, based on a 
controller from Xilinx's memory interface generator (MIG), with a small cache
memory and Wishbone wrapper.

The xilinx_ddr2_wb_if.v is a 3-master arbiter for the controller.
The xilinx_ddr2_if.v is the actual interface between the Wishbone bus and 
Xilinx MIG control interface.

When synthesizing, take note of the xilinx_ddr2_if_cache module, that is a 
dual-port memory, with different aspects on each size, and cannot be inferred. 
The NGC should be in the appropriate place in the synthesis or backend 
directories.

Wishbone B3-compliant bursting is yet to be implemented.
